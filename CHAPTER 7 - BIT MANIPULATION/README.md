# Bit Manipulation
## Decimal Number System(Base 10):
The decimal number system employs employing 10 as the base and requiring 10 different numerals, the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
It also requires a dot (decimal point) to represent decimal fractions.

## Binary Number System(Base 2):
The number system which is designed for computers and works using 0s and 1s is referred to as the Binary Number System.
The base of a binary number system is 2.
#### [HOTS]:
**Why does computer only understand Binary???**
Because computer is a electronic machine which can only function using two states i.e. ON or OFF. Each of the two states detemine if the current is flowing (ON) or the current is not flowing (OFF)

### A Decimal Number:
For example, the number 123 can be written as: 
1* 100+ 2* 10+3*1

### A Binary Number:
A binary number contains a string with 0's or 1's or a combination of both.

## Understanding data-type int:

At the lowest level, a machine only understand binary. A binary digit is called a bit. Memory is byte addressable.Each bytes can contain 8 bits.
